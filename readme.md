Osm(Sharp) Data Processor
=========================

ODP is a simple tool that exposes some of OsmSharp's functionality to act as a CLI tool to process OpenSteetMap-data.

Basic supported features are:

- Reading/writing OSM-XML (.osm).
- Reading/writing OSM-PBF (.osm.pbf).
- Merging multiple sources.
- Creating and writing OsmSharp-routing format file.
- Creating routable shapefiles based on OSM-data.

Everything ODP can, you can also do by writing code and using OsmSharp and OsmSharp.Routing but this tool allows you to setup regular update processes for example.

## Documentation

All relevant documentation is on the [wiki](https://github.com/OsmSharp/odp/wiki). Only the features documented there are supported.
